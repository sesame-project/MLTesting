#DeepKnowledge: Knowledge-Driven Automated testing tool of deep-neural-network
######This is the SESAME Assurance of tool-supported technique Data-Driven and Learning Components of EDDIs


This code is implementation of our tool-supported technique DeepKnowledge.
It is a beta version provided as a reference to the approach presented in the delivrable 6.1. 
If you encounter any problem do not hesitate to reach out to York team (sondess.missaoui@york.ac.uk).

Scripts are tested with the open-source machine learning framework Keras (v2.2.2) with Tensorflow (v2.6) backend.

##Abstract
The increasing use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in safety- and security-critical applications created an urgent need for effective DNN testing techniques
capable of establishing the dependability levels of DNNs.
Despite noteworthy advances, recent research proposes testing techniques and coverage criteria that focus primarily on the analysis of the DNN 
behaviour using the conventional training-validation-testing DNN practice, often neglecting important generalisation capabilities exhibited by DNNs. 
We address this gap by introducing DeepKnowledge, a systematic testing methodology for DNNs founded on the principle of knowledge transfer. 
Our empirical evaluation of several DNNs, across multiple datasets and state-of-the-art adversarial generation techniques demonstrates 
the usefulness and effectiveness of DeepKnowledge and its ability to support the engineering of more dependable DNNs.
DeepKnowledge provides to our partners an easy and effective assurance technique for their Machine Learning componenets.
our tool in a simple multi-paradigm technology, i.e., using a set of Python scripts. 
This enables a quick adaptation and code maintenance by our partners. 
The developed prototype tool is also compatible with most systems and architectures used by our industrial partners in SESAME.
