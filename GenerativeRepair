# GenerativeRepair: Semantic Data Augmentation Methodology for Deep Learning Hardening and Repairing using Generative AI
###### This is the SESAME Hardening and Repairing Framework of Data-Driven and Learning Components of EDDIs

The code for our framework GenerativeRepair is available to execution using two main scipts repairing.py and fuzzing.py.
It is in beta version and provided as a reference to the approaches and methodologies presented in deliverable 6.4. 
If you encounter any problems, do not hesitate to reach out to the York team (sondess.missaoui@york.ac.uk).
